		<p class="blueLightest bumper-top">
			WindowCleaning.com is a national network of the <strong>best window cleaners</strong> in each city. In most cities, <strong>only one window cleaner is chosen out of hundreds</strong> of window cleaners! Each window cleaner is interviewed personally by one of our team. We verify their level of experience, if they are properly insured, their reputation in the industry, and how their customers feel about the service they provide. Then we choose the best.

			You can be sure, that by choosing a WindowCleaning.com awarded member, you are choosing the best. And to back it up, all WindowCleaning.com members offer our no hassle <strong>$1000 Streak Free Guarantee!</strong>
