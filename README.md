# Playground

The Playground WP Theme is a blank theme that serves as a testing area for the Toolbox Framework. The themes only components are toolbox-framework dependencies.

## Code collaboration

Developers working on the Toolbox-Framework should make a local clone of the playground theme which includes the Toolbox-Framework as a GIT submodule. Branch off the master for each new feature. Send a pull request with all the details when the branch has been thoroughly well tested, code is fully commented and ready to be merged with the staging branch. *Developers are NEVER permitted to push changes to the staging or master branch without code review first.*
