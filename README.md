# Playground

The Playground WP Theme is a blank theme that serves as a testing area for the Toolbox Framework. The themes only components are toolbox-framework dependencies.

## Development

Developers working on the Toolbox-Framework should make a local clone of the playground theme which includes the Toolbox-Framework as a GIT submodule. Well tested, stable code, can be pushed to the staging branch for code review and final QA testing. *Developers should NEVER push to the master branch or merge changes in the staging branch to the master branch.*
